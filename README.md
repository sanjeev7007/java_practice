# ðŸš€ Java Coding Journey: From Beginner to Pro

Welcome to my **Java Coding Practice** repository! ðŸŒ± This space is a reflection of my daily journey as I learn Java, solve challenges, and build projects one line of code at a time. Whether you're a fellow coder or just curious about my progress, feel free to explore!

## ðŸŽ¯ My Mission:
As a beginner, I'm diving deep into the world of Java to develop a strong foundation in programming. This repository is dedicated to my daily coding practices, ranging from basic syntax to tackling real-world problems. I aim to master key concepts like:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Solving coding challenges
- Building small Java projects

## ðŸ“š What's Inside:
Here you'll find:
- **Java Exercises**: Daily challenges that help me improve core concepts like loops, conditionals, and arrays.
- **Mini Projects**: Fun, small Java projects to experiment with and improve my coding skills.
- **Algorithm Practice**: Solutions to problems that test my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
  
Each day I aim to add new content, so stay tuned for more updates!
